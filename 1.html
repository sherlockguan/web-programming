    <h1> Fire and Ice</h1>
    <p>Some say the world will end in fire,<br>Some say in ice. </p>
    <p>From what I've tasted of desire<br>I hold with those whoe favor fire,</p>
    <p>But if it had to perish twice,</p>
    <p>I think I know enouth of hate </p>
    <p>To say that for destruction ice <br>Is also great<br>And would suffice</p>
